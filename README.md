## Project Introduction
This case study is an analysis of one-hundred styles of beer brewed in the United States for the executive team, CEO and CFO at Budweiser. Budweiser is interested in exploring the how many breweries are in the United States and the importance of the International Bitterness Unit (IBU) and Alcohol By Volume (ABV) variables' values to beer.  

The data analysis will include handling missing data, explaining why it was possibly not included in the initial data set and impute if necessary. It will also explore the ABV and IBU variables in terms of their correlated or dependent relationship and any inferences that can be made from either the variables individually or combined. 

Conclusions will include basic summary statics on the variables, inferences drawn from them or their relationship(s) and any business opportunities that may present themselves.

## Questions For Analysis
1.   How many breweries are present in each state?
2.   Address the missing values in each column.
3.   Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
4.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
5.   Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
6.   Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.
7.  Explore IBU and ABV differences.
    1. Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.
    2. In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this relationship (KNN is required) you may also feel free to supplement your response to this question with any other methods or techniques you have learned.  Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.  
8. Knock their socks off!  Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in.  You must convince them why it is important and back up your conviction with appropriate statistical evidence.
