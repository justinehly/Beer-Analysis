## Project Introduction
This case study is an analysis of one-hundred styles of beer brewed in the United States for the executive team, CEO and CFO at Budweiser. Budweiser is interested in exploring the how many breweries are in the United States and the importance of the International Bitterness Unit (IBU) and Alcohol By Volume (ABV) variables' values to beer.  

The data analysis will include handling missing data, explaining why it was possibly not included in the initial data set and impute if necessary. It will also explore the ABV and IBU variables in terms of their correlated or dependent relationship and any inferences that can be made from either the variables individually or combined. 

Conclusions will include basic summary statics on the variables, inferences drawn from them or their relationship(s) and any business opportunities that may present themselves.
